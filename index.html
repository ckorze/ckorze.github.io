        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> I enjoy a lot making teams successful. I consider myself an empathic person capable of leading diverse groups of work and generating a comfortable and friendly environment for the members of the team to feel at ease with the work we do together. I am also in a good mood most of the time and I am always making jokes since I think this helps us to build a relationship that enables us to work with freedom and enjoyment. I am an agile woman and I love being in a learning flow to try new things and improve the ones I'm already into. I'm not perfect but I'm just trying to do my best. </p>
